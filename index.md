__Handwritten Digit Classification based on CNN__                        <span style="float:right">*(Scheduled) Nov. 2020*</span>  
Description: Machine Learning Project  
A handwriting number recognition system (using MNIST) will be implemented based on CNN method. This system must successfully detect and recognize the handwriting numbers (0~9) and transfer them to digital form. In this project, a neural network with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers will be built to fully satisefy function requirements. The optimizer will be Adam.     
<br>


__Barcode Recognition System__                        <span style="float:right">*(Ongoing) Aug. 2020 – Present*</span>  
Description: Image Processing Project  
This design explores the decoding technology of EAN13 barcode recognition. Based on machine vision technology, a set of barcode online detection and recognition system is constructed. The system will consist of the following parts: barcode image positioning and collection, computer image preprocessing, barcode image Median filtering, denoising, barcode analysis and reading. After experiments, it is determined that the system can quickly and accurately read most EAN13 barcodes.

__Face Recognition System based on CNN__                                       <span style="float:right">*Apr. 2020*</span>  
Description: Pattern Recognition Project  
This project develops an online face detection and recognition system based on convolutional neural networks. The system consists of the following parts: making a face data set, CNN neural network model training, face detection, and face recognition. After testing, it was confirmed that the system can quickly and accurately detect and recognize my face. The entire neural network includes eight layers, including three sets of convolutional layers and pooling layers, a fully connected layer and an output layer. The loss function is cross entropy and the optimizer is Adam. The codes of this project are written in Python. The libraries used in this project are OpenCV, DLIB and Tensorflow.

__The Most Popular Hashtag Counter using Fibonacci Heap__                                               <span style="float:right">*Mar. 2020*</span>  
Description: Data Structures Project  
This project proposes a fully functional hashtag counter. In this project, I build the following two data structures: Max Fibonacci Heap to keep track of frequencies of hashtags, hash table to save the key and the value of the corresponding node in the Fib-heap. The codes of the project consist of three parts: hashtag_counter, Fib_NodeStructure and Fib_Heap. After testing, the system successfully reproduced all the functions of the Fibonacci Heap (insert, remove, compare&combine, increase&decrease key, cascading cut , etc.). This project is completed with Java.

__Granary Storage Control System__                         <span style="float:right"> *Aug. 2017* </span>   
Description: College Students Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition  
This project takes the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor as the core, and the AT89c51 single-chip microcomputer designs a scale-down warehouse model for the processor. The model has some functions that the warehouse should have for normal detection: turn on the heater when the temperature is below the threshold, turn on the heat dissipation window and alarm when the temperature or humidity is too high, and implement temperature information display on LCD1602. Circuit diagram simulation and drawing are done by Multisim software. The outer shell’s design is accomplished by Solidworks.

__Intelligent Agriculture System based on Wind Power Tech__      <span style="float:right">*June 2017* </span>  
Description: The Challenge Cup Sci. & Tech Competition   
This goal of this competition is to design a reservation room for vegetables. In this project, three main section are successfully implemented: Energy supply part, detection and control part, deworming part. My responsibility is designing a device to monitor the humidity and temperature of the environment. In this process, I use AT89c51 SCM and DHT11 digital sensor to accomplish a detection and control system. Circuit diagram simulation and drawing are done by Multisim.

__Portable Ticket Machine at Railway Station__                                       <span style="float:right"> *Apr. 2016* </span>   
Description: College Students Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition  
This design takes FX-2N-32MR PLC as the core, and designs a subway ticketing device that meets currency recognition, calculates fares based on the start and stop stations, and provides automatic refunds. In addition to the main functions, this design also uses computer configuration software to achieve simple control. In this design, my responsibility is to write the program of PLC by GX developer and design the outer shell by 3Ds Max.
